# Chatter

WIP web chatting application in Typescript with React and NestJS.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo-style setup containing two main packages:
- `chatter-backend`: The backend service built with NestJS, providing a GraphQL API and using MongoDB.
- `chatter-ui`: The frontend user interface built with React, Vite, and Apollo Client for GraphQL interactions.

## Tooling

- **Prettier**: Code formatting is enforced across the workspace.
- **Package Manager**: Backend uses Bun/pnpm concepts and Frontend uses Vite-based npm/yarn setup.
